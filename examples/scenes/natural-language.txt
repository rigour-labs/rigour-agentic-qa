receives an invitation email with a unique link, clicking the link starts
a video interview session, and the interviewer can join the same session.
The interview should have a 60-minute time limit.

Test that the API rate limiter kicks in after 100 requests per minute.
The 101st request should get a 429 response with a Retry-After header.
